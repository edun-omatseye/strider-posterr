# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

Launches the json server that will act as the backend rest api server

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Planning 

The Product Manager wants to implement a new feature called "reply-to-post".
First off, all the requirements are very clear. Basically having a post that uses @mentioning at the beginning to indicate a reply directly to a post which shows up in a tab under profile page and not homepage.
My questions would be design questions:
**Is it best to use tabs or toggle button to flip between regular posts and secondaty feed**

Implementation of "reply-to-post".
Database design would now include a new table called "reply" and would have a direct relationship with the "post" table.
Front-end design would pop up a modal with the current post and a textbox under to receieve your reply to the post.
A successful reply would post the message via api to the backend.

## Critique

One major thing i would have love to work on if the time would allow was the user's CRUD aspect and Authentication of users. I feel without this part an application is not complete.

Meanwhile lets talk about scaling, looking at it from the frontend perspective, if this project were to grow and have many users and posts, is to migrate the app from monolithic architecture to micro services.
